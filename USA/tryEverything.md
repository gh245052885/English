* Oh oh oh oh oooh
* I messed up tonight  I lost another fight
* I still mess up but I'll just start again
* I keep falling down
* I keep on hitting the ground
* But I always get up now to see what's next
* Birds don't just fly they fall down and get up
* * Nobody learns without getting it wrong
* I won't give up  No I won't give in tilI l reach the end,
 * and then I'll start again
*  No I won't leave I wanna try everything
* I wanna try even though I could fail
* I won't give up
* No I won't give in till I reach the end,
* and then I'll start again
* No I won't leave I wanna try everything
* I wanna try even though I could fail
* Oh oh oh oh oooh
* Try everything
* Oh oh oh oh oooh
* Try everything
* Oh oh oh oh oooh
* Try everything
* Oh oh oh oh oooh
* * Look at how far you've come
* You filled your heart with love
* Maybe you've done enough
* Take a deep breath
* Don't beat yourself up
* Don't need to run so fast
* Sometimes we come last but we did our best
* I won't give up
* No I won't give in till I reach the end,
* and then I'll start again
* No I won't leave I wanna try everything
* I wanna try even though I could fail
* I won't give up
* No I won't give in till I reach the end,
* and then I'll start again
* I wanna try even though I could fail
* I'll keep on making those new mistakes
* I'll keep on making them every day
* Those new mistakes
