## Trouble
Trouble will find you no mater where you go oh oh[1] 
No Matter if you're fast no matter if you're slow oh oh
The eye of the storm and the cry in the morn oh oh
Your fine for a while but then start to loose control
He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the winds
He's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine oh oh
Trouble is a friend but trouble is a foe oh oh
And no matter what
I feed him he always seems to grow oh oh
He sees what I see and he knows what I know oh oh
So don't forget as you ease on down the road
He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the winds
He's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine oh oh
So don't be alarmed if he takes you by the arm
I won't let him win but I'm a sucker for his charm
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine Oh oh
Oh how I hate the way he makes me feel
And how I try to make him leave I try
Oh Oh I try
He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the winds
He's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine oh oh
So don't be alarmed if he takes you by the arm
I won't let him win but I'm a sucker for his charm
Trouble is a friend
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine Oh oh


# yesterday

Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
Now i looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday[5] 
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me.
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go I don't know she wouldn't say
I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday
Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Hmm[6] 

## Far Away From Home
I'm loving living every single day but sometimes I feel so....
I hope to find a little peace of mind and I just want to know.
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be.
Where is home on the milkyway of stars, I dry my eyes again.
In my dreams I'm not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
without you I'll be so far away from home
If we could make it through he darkest Night we'd have a brighter day.
the world I see beyond your pretty eyes, makes me want to stay.
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be.
Where is home on the milkyway of stars, I dry my eyes again.
In my dreams I'm not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
without you I'll be so far away from home
I count on you, no matter what they say, cause love can find it's time.
I hope to be a part of you again, baby let us shine.
And who can heal those tiny broken hearts, and what are we to be.
Where is home on the milkyway of stars, I dry my eyes again.
In my dreams I'm not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
without you I'll be so far away from home
In my dreams I'm not so far away from home
What am I in a world so far away from home
All my life all the time so far away from home
without you I'll be so far away from home

## Because of you
I will not make
The same mistakes that you did
I will not let myself
Cause my heart so much misery
I will not break
The way you did, you fell so hard
I've learned the hard way
To never let it get that far
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I lose my way
And it's not too long before you point it out
I cannot cry
Because I know that's weakness in your eyes
I'm forced to fake
A smile, a laugh everyday of my life
My heart can't possibly break
When it wasn't even whole to start with
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I find it hard to trust not only me, but everyone around me
Because of you
I am afraid
I watched you die
I heard you cry every night in your sleep
I was so young
You should have known
Better than to lean on me
You never thought of anyone else
You just saw your pain
And now I cry in the middle of the night
For the same damn thing
Because of you
I never stray too far from the sidewalk
Because of you
I learned to play on the safe side so I don't get hurt
Because of you
I try my hardest just to forget everything
Because of you
I don't know how to let anyone else in
Because of you
I'm ashamed of my life
Because it's empty
Because of you
I am afraid
Because of you
Because of you[1]

And she said
We are all just prisoners here of our own device
In the master's chambers
They gathered for the feast
Stab it with their steely knives
But they just can't kill the beast
Last thing I remember I was
Running for the door
I had to find the passage back
To the place I was before
Relax said the night man
